# Solving Ethernaut Dex Challenge

Ethernaut Dex has a major flaw in it's getSwapPrice function to calculate amount due to the user in case of swap.
The amount is purely based on contract's balances at the time of the swap, and does not involve a proper constanct product formula, to check liquidity of the tokens and ensure the user is not getting more tokens at the loss of the Dex.

# Exploit Path

    -Approve both tokens
    -Swap either token 1 or token 2 for the entire balance of the user.
    -Now do the same and keep swapping the entire balance of Token 1 or Token 2 until the contract is drained.
