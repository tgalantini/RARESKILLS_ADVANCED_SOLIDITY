## Revisit the solidity events tutorial. How can OpenSea quickly determine which NFTs an address owns if most NFTs donâ€™t use ERC721 enumerable? Explain how you would accomplish this if you were creating an NFT marketplace
    If i were opensea or an NFT marketplace and i had to determine which NFTs an address owns, i would simply start a scan of the blockchain, targetting events "transferFrom" and "safeTransferFrom" involving NFT contracts, from and to the address. There is no need to filter all transactions in a block, the Bloom filter can be used to retrieve all events that occur in a block making this cheaper in terms of computation. Once retrieved all events involving an address, a simple script can determine what NFTs are currently owned by the address, filtering out the NFTs that the address has sent out. Moreover, mantaining an off-chain database can help a lot in terms of computation, if all the known NFTs are mapped in a DB, keeping track of the owners, retrieving and updating data can be much faster.
